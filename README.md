Follow these steps to run the project on your local server (e.g., XAMPP/WAMP):

1.  **Clone Repository:** `git clone [repository link]`
2.  **Database Setup:** Import the provided `stock_tracker.sql` file into your local MySQL database (e.g., via phpMyAdmin).
3.  **Configuration:** Create a file named **`connection.php`** in the root directory and insert your local database connection details (hostname, username, password) following the project's logic. *(Note: This sensitive file is intentionally excluded from this public repository for security.)*

## 2. Rule for Live Credentials ðŸ”‘

The **test account** you created is the correct solution.

* **Do Not Share Your Actual Credentials:** Never put your personal or production passwords on the resume or in the README.
* **Test Account Purpose:** By sharing the `demo@test.com` / `password123` account, you allow the employer to **immediately access** and test your application without compromising your security.
